# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction
I compiled all my projects to showcase the skills I developed partaking in the Data Science course with Tech Talent Academy. I used Python (NumPy & Pandas), R, SQL, and Microsoft Excel to create user input programmes, input data and created visualisations. 

## Python
### What is Python?

Python is on of the most used computer programming language that is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis and visualisation. It is described as an all-purpose language which can be used to create a variety of different programmes. Using Python I created some basic user input programmes, passing and procedures parameteter to perform basic calculations and a loop programme.

### Mini Python Projects
Project 1 – Creating a random number guessing game: 

This code demonstrates how I created a random number guessing game by creating a user input programme to type in any number of choice to generate a reponse on whether the user won the game or not.

Project 2 – Creating a selection menu for a restaurant order:

I created a resturant style menu user input programme which asks the user what starter, main course, dessert and drink of their choice. The output displays the full order of the customer.

Project 3 – Creating an interactive programme number game: 

This code shows how to create an interactive number guessing game. The user has to guess any number between 1-100; I programmed the game to have a few selection of numbers between 1-100 that will output a joke if the user guessed the number correctly, and any number that's not included in that selection will not generate a joke.

Project 4 – Coronavirus Home-Testing Kit Eligibilty: 

This is an example of a data flow diagram I created to plan, breakdown and visualise the steps to create a User Input Programme. The goal was to create an eligibility criteria for customers to order a Coronavirus Home-Testing kit. Using the data flow diagram as my plan to create a code to execute a User Input Programme with multiple conditions in order to filter out the users that were elgible for the home-testing kits from those that would not be able to qualify.

Project 5 – Creating procedures and passing parameters to perform calculations:

I created a calculation user input programme that would perform basic calculations, as well as using procedures and passing parameters; which pictures below demonstrates. In order to ensure the validity of calculation programme I ensured that there was a condition to display an error message if none of the choice of math operators were used.

Project 6 - Creating a student grade converter:

This code demonstrates how I created a grade converter for students to convert percentages into a grade. It has a condition that if the percentage falls below 50% then the output will change into a 'You have failed' message instead of a grade.

![](https://github.com/angongcelenica/Data-Science-Project-Portfolio/blob/main/images/Python/gradefail.png)


Project 7 - Yearly motorbike depreciation of 10% until it reaches below £1000:

This code demonstrates a loop programme to show the 10% yearly depreciation of a motorbike until it reaches below £1000. The starting price of the motorbike was £2000 and the programme calculated and printed the result for each year until it finally hit below £1000 in Year 8.

## Numpy & Pandas
NumPy is a library for Python that uses mathematical functions on large datasets and multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. Additionally Pandas is high level data manipultion tool that uses dataframes and series to analyse the data. It can also be used to build on packages such as NumPy which uses numerical data whereas Pandas uses tabular data.

### Numpy

Numpy is a great tool for data analysis on arrays because it performs various tasks and handles large datasets effectively and efficiently at fast speeds. Arrays are described as a collection of values that can have one or more dimensions. An array with one dimension is normally known as a vector and two dimensions is a matrix. As you can see below I explored the basic NumPy functions to create arrays, perform basic calculations and reshaping or slicing arrays.

### Pandas

Pandas is a library within Python which can be used in addition to other packages such as NumPy. Pandas can be used for data manipulation, analysis and data visualisation because of how easy it is to import, visualise and analyse data. I used Jupyter Notebook to import external data from a CSV file to analyse the data using Pandas and NumPy. As you can see below this is a hypothetical example of analysing data for stakeholders that want information on which holiday destination, city and hotel are the most popular with high or low ratings. This allows the stakeholders to understand what business decisions they need to make which can result in taking action by removing the worst rated destination off their website. Moreover, I accomplished this by performing calculations to find the mean, max, min and filtering the data with conditions and boolean indexing.

![](https://github.com/angongcelenica/Data-Science-Project-Portfolio/blob/main/images/Python/pandascsv5.png)

### Data Visualisations

The next step in the process is to simplify and communicate the data visually so the stakeholders are able to understand the results. Below it shows a scatter plot that visualises the correlation between all-inclusive hotels and score of the destination and that the more all-inclusive hotels there are the likelehood the score will be higher. I also created a bar chart to visualise all the destinations and their score.

## R
R is an Integrated Programming Environment (IDE) mainly used for statistical data analysis, visualisation and machine learning projects. R has multiple built in library tools to make data cleaning and analysis more simple and convenient.

### Writing a Basic R Program
R has mulitple built-in functions that can be used for data input/output, structure and variables, the projects below demontsrate the different ways in which you can use them. In order to create a basic R program I assigned a value to a variable that you can continue to build on. I created a basic user input program that required the users name and age. I assigned values to a variable that will generate a list of personal information as the output. After creating a sequence of numbers(20-50, 20-60, 51-91) I used built in functions to calculate the mean and sum. I was also able to create a vector of 10 random interger values with a boolean type, these projects show how convenient the built in functions are. I also created a data frame with personal information of employees to include their name, age, role, gender and length of service as a way to demonstrate the variety of ways you can use R to create data frames.

### Using R for Data Visualisations
This is an example of using built in packages to simplify the data visualisation process by demonstrating how I used 'ggplot2'. Firstly, you must import the ggplot library in order to activate the packages to enable the use of functions. As you can see I created some data frames, vectors and matrices to build the foundation to start plotting the data on the graph. This enabled me to create a histogram chart to visualise the weekly lateness frequency rates of employees, a scatter plot to show the attendence rates of students once the schools had reopened, lastly a bar chart to visualise the number of used cars sold in 2019 by car make.

## SQL
### What is SQL ?
The Structured Query Language (SQL) is designed to communicate with databases and is widely used for most relational database systems. It can be used for creating, accessing and manipulating which allows for searching, storing, updating, editing, retrieving and deleting data from a database.

### Creating a database, running complex queries & joining tables
I developed 2 databases with the goal of creating a relational database. The tables contain customers' personal information and order details which are in seperate databases. In order to create a relational database I used the JOIN clause to compile the customers' personal and order details into one table to make it easier to view and retrieve data if needed. As you can see below I demonstrated how I used other SQL statements to retrieve data from a table.

## Modelling Data 
### What is Data Modelling?
Data Modelling is the process of investigating real life scenarios from current or previous data by creating a visual representation of the outcome. A great example of this definition are businesses using previous sales data to predict which products are more profitable or weather forecasters using a model of the atmosphere to predict the weather.

Using Microsoft Excel I created a spreadsheet model based on a dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.com which was based on petrol consumption. I used the data from the dataset ([dataset link](https://github.com/angongcelenica/Data-Science-Project-Portfolio/blob/main/datasets/petrol_consumption%2021.xlsx)) to base it on cities across the UK to create a hypothetical scenario. To begin modelling the data I performed some basic calculations and used built in formulas within Microsoft Excel such as AUTOSUM, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE, COUNT and COUNTIF. I used the VLOOKUP formula to make it easier to look up specific information in the dataset. Microsoft has a great feature known as Validation which allows you to control the type of data entered in your worksheet, using the Validation function I was able to ensure only data from 2019 was entered.

### Data Visualisations
To create data visualisations I designed a scatter plot to visualise the average petrol tax based on income, it showed that the average petrol tax is £7.76 and the average income of the population is £30,205.96 per year. I created a horizontal bar chart which visualises the number of paved highways based on cities in the UK which illustrated that Salford had the highest amount of paved highways in the UK.
